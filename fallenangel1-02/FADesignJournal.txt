"But Why" (The Decision)

With LotC missions 19 and 20 still ahead, as well as Platinum edition and the entire third
campaign, a lot of people, including me sometimes, may wonder why we spent all this time working
on Fallen Angel instead.  Truth is, Joel (you know, the ultimate artist, Joel, co-creator of
LotC) was extremely busy for a few weeks with his gig at Ethermoon, and doing some other
miscellaneous tasks.  Since Missions 19 and 20 required a fair bit of graphics work from him, he
asked me to work on a short mini-campaign to 'tide fans over' until he could chew out the 
images.

Well, needless to say that was a joke.  What was supposed to be a very simple bit of campaign
work to tide people over became, almost a full blown campaign by itself, now boasting five
missions with voice, music, portraits, and even a movie!  I entirely blame 'feature creep' for
what happened by the way.  It just seemed cool to 'add' this feature or 'add' that feature,
until we added so much, we had to add more, and more, and...well, you get the idea.

Anyhow, with the decision to create the mini-campaign in hand, there had to be a concept.  What
would it be about?  An event in the LotC universe?  A character?  Backstory?  It was a tough 
call.

***********************************************************************************************

"Every Fruit has pits" (Concept)

Concept is the foundation of any creative endeavor, at least I think so.  Summarize, in a single
sentence, what the campaign is about.  I finally decided to base the mini-campaign around a
character that was then unknown, named Ambrosia.  Having a vital role in the third campaign
installment as well as appearing in mission 19, she was a logical choice.  Besides, I figured it
would be the perfect opportunity to present exposition on the Keepers organization and Remus' 
pirate clans (one of ConFed's domestic enemies) as well.

So, the concept summary sentence became:  "The life and times of Janine Richter, aka Ambrosia."


"It's not that you get there it's HOW you get there" Story:

I've always preferred to let the story write itself.  I had some basic ideas in mind, such as
that the first mission would involve Ambrosia when she was in the Confederation.  But as to 
'why' she joined the Keepers, or how she ended up in mission 19, or what part the Keepers play in
LotC, none of that was decided going in.

As I laid out the maps, missions, and objectives, the storyline took shape on its own, and I
became a backseat driver to the events that unfolded.  New characters emerged that I never would
have imagined just sitting in my chair thinking about it.  Many times, I was as eager to see 
what happens as someone just playing the game, and many a late hour went to discovering the plot 
twists.

There were no timelines, no outlines.  These devices, at least for me, constrict how I tell a
story.  I don't like 'having' to adhere to an outline to ensure everything flows.  I prefer to
just 'go with it' and see where it takes me.  In this case, the story rounded off very nicely,
and adhered to the traditional literary five step program of "Introduction, Rising
Action...etc..."  The story even answers questions players had asked us in e-mails and on the
forums such as "Why did the Zerg attack Dionysus and rekindle the war with Earth" and "What
happened to Mallock from LotC 1?"


**********************************************************************************************

"What's in a name?" (Characters Part 1)

First and foremost, I wanted to avoid having any 'cliche' characters.  I didn't want the keepers
to just be emotionless assassins, I didn't want bit characters (such as the base commander at
Dionysus) to be a routine flight controllers or routine guards.  I wanted them to have 
personality, something for the player to latch onto, or at the very least, something that makes 
them seem 'alive.'

The first step to avoiding cliche comes with names.  Take names like Prescott, Smith, John,
James, Goldman, etc..., these are average names, easily forgotten.  Even for minor characters, 
this is important.  Case in point, look at the character "Luke Skywalker" in Star Wars.  I don't 
think anyone in the world has this name.  Luke is rare enough, but Skywalker?  Same with Han 
Solo.

Taking this one step further, the names should be representative of their character.  Again, Luke 
Skywalker, you know, walking amongst the heavens, which he does, going from farmboy to Jedi 
Knight throughout the course of the trilogy.  Same with Han Solo.  What was he?  A mercenary, a
solo rider.  Great stuff.  I wanted to capture a similar essence when naming different 
characters in Fallen Angel.

The primary character, "Ambrosia" has two names.  "Angel" for when she is in ConFed (A guardian 
angel, benevolent as an angel, a force of justice like the angel of heaven) to Ambrosia later on,
which is "Nectar of the Gods" in greek mythology, indicating her narcissism as a result of 
joining the Keepers.  (Notice her name is not derived from any words synonymous with "Evil" 
however.  This was intentional, and reasons for it will be explained in LotC part 3.)  The Keeper
"Stillwell" was named after Rob 'Stillwell' Morton of the "Cowboy" gang back in the wild west, a
brutal killer responsible for more murders than Billy the Kid.  He was effective, but alienated
much of the Cowboy group with his brusque attitude.  The name Tank tries to embody that he's
'tough' but dumb, all in one word.  Giovanni, leader of the Keepers has a name common in higher
Mafia echelons (the Mafia being an organization that resembles the keepers in a lot of ways.)
  
Naming the Keepers individually was a big "IF".  I wasn't sure at the outset that the Keepers 
would all be independent characters.  Originally, it would just be Ambrosia and four generic 
Keepers.  In the end, because you'd be using the Keepers for four out of the five missions, it 
became important to differentiate them from one another, so each evolved into a leading role.

Keep in mind also that locations had relevant names.  Dionysus (the god of wine and 'partying'
in greek mythology), was a play on words, as Dionysus was among the most boring, run-down, and
un-exciting places in the Confederation (evidenced at the start of the level.)  Kinda
something for the colonists to ridicule.  "Dionysus?  Yeah right."

Ambrosia's ship is named "Sphinx" after the egyptian sphinx.  An enigma, mysterious.

See if you can find the other name associations in the campaign.

*********************************************************************************************

"Personality Schmersonality" (Characters Part II)

I wanted to avoid the cliche 'mindless serious assassin type' that people might expect from a
group like the Keepers.  Television and gaming media is saturated with these.  Stone-cold
assassins that have no feeling or emotion, like the Terminator but they're not robots they're
people, so it's not nearly as cool.  

I wanted to portray the Keepers as flawed characters (Stillwell annoys the group, Tank is slow in
the head, Ambrosia is egocentric) but at the same time, portray them as ruthless and efficient
killers, good at what they do, and unstoppable.  The fact they chit chat with each other between
kills hopefully shows how little they care about human life, even less than one of those serious
assassin types because to the Keepers, it's just a job, like taking out the trash or flipping 
burgers.  They can do it with little or no concentration, and they do it well.  They'd tell a 
joke to the group while putting a gun to someone's head and pulling the trigger, and they'd lay 
out a deck of cards and play a game under heavy enemy fire because they are THAT confident in 
their abilities.  It's a degree of apathy and power that can't be shown if the assassin is 
stern-faced and serious all the time, and as such, is designed to make the Keepers even more 
fearsome of a unit.

Other characters are given unique personalities as well.  The Dionysus commanding officer, 
Commander Reeves, is the grizzled, anti-bureaucratic hillbilly stuck in command of a backwater 
refueling outpost, hating every minute of it.  Sergeant Meyers, Angel's best friend on Dionysus,
hates ConFed security (he has two run-ins with them in that mission), and loses his cool and 
'freezes' during the zerg invasion, indicating his inability to cope with a combat situation. 
Remus (named after the legendary wolf 'Romulus' brother), pirate leader, doesn't say 'avast ye 
matey' and 'arrr' but instead is a former ConFed captain gone renegade.  A security guard at the 
pirate installation in mission 3 begs and pleads for his life before being killed, while another 
at the station does not.  The Judicator in mission 3 and 4 hates Terrans.  

Injecting every voiced character with a distinct personality was a big goal when making FA.  I 
wanted no 'stock' characters.  (A stock character being someone that speaks or acts just as a 
plot device, with no real motivation or characterization.  They're just 'extras.')  Every 
character has a quirk, something to remember them by.  Whether people actually 'remember' them,
that remains to be seen ;)

********************************************************************************************

"Darwinism at its finest" (Characters Part III)

Characters are driven by the story.  As events unfold, it is the characters that must deal with
them lest they be dealt with.  In the case of Fallen Angel, it was important to have the main
characters evolve in some way.

The leading character, Ambrosia, starts out as a loyal Confederation soldier, then, after being
left to die by her own comrades in arms after helping them escape certain destruction, she
snaps, and seeks vengeance on those that left her, murdering them and anyone that happened
into her way.

She further evolves (or degrades) into an assassin.  From a 'good guy' to 'killer bent on 
vengeance' to 'cold-blooded killer of innocents.'  The different maps in the Fallen Angel 
campaign show this gradual 'degradation' of Angel/Ambrosia's character.

If the characters remain the same all the way through, then it's harder to relate to the story
as no one is really 'affected' by it.  Characters MUST change as a result of the story.

Using another example, Engineer Bill (Mission 1: Dionysus), whines several times about not
having enough power cores for the colony, about having to work double shifts due to a lack
of proper equipment and staff in engineering, and a general distaste for his job.  When the
Zerg attack the colony though, he stuffs it and stays to the end, maintaining power to the
colony so that everyone can evacuate rather than skipping out himself, even at the cost of 
his own life.

From 'whining discontent' to 'whining hero'.

Every character in Fallen Angel that has more than a couple of voiced lines will show some
degree of change as the story progresses.  See if you can figure out the rest.

*******************************************************************************************

"Does terrain need to look real?" (Level Design Part I)

Yes it does.  Not to make the level 'more' realistic but to keep it from looking 'unrealistic.'
Great care was taken in the terrain layout of each level.  When there are cliffs, you'll see no 
straight edges, nothing is squared off.

In installations, the wall tiles aren't just random (like the access panel or the oval windows
that are available).  The tiles are all uniform, just walls.  The only place you'll see access
panels are near doors or important areas.  The only place you'll see the oval windows are in
the installation's living area.

Same with Dionysus.  It's divided into four sections.  
**A power section (with a lot of access panels on the structure walls) but no windows.  Also the
trees in that area are more 'dead' than in other parts of the colony due to radiation from the 
fusion generator inside.
**"The colony and living" area has two parts connected by a bridge.  On one side is a 
recreational area complete with a small shopping outlet and a 'park' of sorts, with lots of 
trees and places for people to go relax.  The other is the living area, replete with lots of 
doors and windows.  Much like side by side apartments.
**The main section of the colony (where you mine minerals and find the teleporter hub), that's 
dominated by the military since they have to keep track of who's coming in by land from a 
neighboring outpost, and also to guard the teleporter hub and the resources supplies.
**The launch area is on a high cliff area, with no living or recreational aspects.  Missile
turrets are in a larger quantity here as this is where incoming ships land.

Look at the asphalt in mission 2 during the flashback scenes.  For major Confederation centers
you'll notice it's completely smooth, not a rough edge, pothole, or blemish anywhere.  But if
you notice in the flashback to Detroit, Michigan, you'll see it's all messed up, with the road
lumpy, the walls have broken glass, indicating that it's a seedy joint that Angel's walking into.

The details are everything.  Again, most people probably won't even 'notice' the precision with
which you build a level.  Many people won't notice that you only put windows in certain areas.
But they WILL notice if you don't.  Some things people take for granted, they expect terrain to
look real.  If it looks real, they likely won't notice it.  If it doesn't look real, they will
notice it and it will detract them from the story.

Real terrain helps immerse the player in the story.  As such, painstaking effort was made in
the design of every level of Fallen Angel to create that level of realism.

**********************************************************************************************

"Doohickey, Whatchamacallit" (Level Design Part II -- Doodads)

Doodads are as important if not moreso than the terrain design.  Once you design your terrain
realistically, the doodads available in StarCraft give it life, much like furnishing a new
apartment.  You need them.

They can't just be placed anywhere however.  Their placement must make sense with the layout of
the level.  You also have to make sure that the 'same' doodad is not used too much in one place
or it will stick out.

For example, in the Badlands terrain there are "4" live tree types.  You need to mix those
together if more than one tree is visible on the screen, otherwise it will 'look' like a doodad
instead of a tree and the player will notice that, detracting them from the story.

Look at mission 2.  Notice on the part where you have to move from safe spot to safe spot, a lot
of trees grow below the cliffs, but none grow on the cliffs because of the constant energy
surges?  Look at the way the trees are arranged, especially at the back.  It's a forest, and it
looks like a forest.  You even have that crashed derelict ship wreckage as signs that the pirates
shot someone down that got too close to the outpost.

Notice on level 2, trees grow around the smaller generators, but the larger one at the end emits
so much radiation, trees wouldn't be able to survive.

In installations you have floortraps.  Use them sparingly.  Either have them as part of a 'trap'
room or have them only appear periodically.  Have them appear in sensible areas (just before a
door for example.)  Traps at random just 'fill' space.  Better to do that with troops.

If you're going to use a 'rock' doodad, make sure it's sensible where you put it.  If you're
going to use a tree, should it be alive or dead?  Once you decide, how many will you put?  Is
it sensible?  What is going on in that area?  Are there a lot of battles there?  If so, chances
are no trees will be standing.

Think about 'why' you put the doodads before you put them.  Once you put them, make sure that
there's variety in which types you use. 

Like with terrain, good doodad placement will go unnoticed by most players, but bad doodad 
placement will be noticed by EVERY player.

**********************************************************************************************

"Bang you're dead" (Level Design Part III -- Objectives)

By the time you design your level, you probably have a rough idea what's going ot happen where.
You know what obstacles a player must overcome to reach certain points of the map.  If not,
then you just need to think about a few things.

When it comes to objectives, take the following into consideration:

**Is the objective new or has it been done before?  If it's been done before, can you improve
it in some way or throw on a twist?  (Example:  Build and destroy missions.  Every campaign
loves these cause they're the easiest.  Computer AI takes away the need to trigger.  So, throw
in a twist.  When your troops reach a certain part of the enemy base, and it looks like they're
defeated (most likely the player has committed all of his/her troops to the fight at that 
point), have a huge surprise attack levied against the player's base by the enemy's reinforce-
ments.  Then the reinforcements take over the base and the player has to improvise and take
it back.

**Is the objective "FUN"?  This is a hard one because fun is many things to many people.  In the
case of FA, some objectives are strictly (move your guys through dangerous areas by timing
alone.)  This was a faux pas as StarCraft is an RTS game and people want to kill stuff.  In 
version 1.02, while the player dodges this or that, they're also under attack by enemies, keeping
the objectives unique, but more fun at the same time.

**Is the objective 'challenging'?  Is a must.  How challenging is up to you.  The harder it is,
the fewer players will be able to beat it on the first try.  (But it is important that EVERY
challenge be beatable on the first try.  That means that a player that's paying attention MUST
be able to win if they pay attention to onscreen instructions and objectives and strategy.) It's
not fair to throw a surprise out of nowhere if a player goes to "Location X" because the player
had no way of knowing it was bad.  But if you warn them first, and they go anyways, then it's
their fault.  A good way to gauge challenge is to play the level yourself.  If it's 'hard' for
you, the creator, it will be twice as hard for the player.  If it's easy for you, it will 
probably be average for the first time player.

**Is the objective 'paced'?  Players should not be able just to chill out and play a level at
their own pace.  There's no tension there, and tension during a level really adds to the mood
of your overall campaign.  Good things to have that add tension are "Countdowns", "Defend your
base objectives", "Bosses," and "Chase Scenes."

In Fallen Angel, I milked everything I could out of the objectives.  In Dionysus you've got some
puzzles to solve, then, when the Zerg attack the colony, you have to worry about mining resources
and building troops, evacuating civilians by moving them between teleporters, and defending four
different parts of the colony, all without getting your hero, Angel, killed.  Later in the level,
Angel and crew are chased by the Zerg, you have to solve a puzzle before the time runs out, and
so on.

There are "10" bosses in Fallen Angel total.  Bosses are big enemies that require unusual amounts
of damage and attacks to be destroyed, while at the same time, they have special attack (usually
triggers) that no normal enemy in StarCraft has.  This is probably too many as some bosses share
attacks with others, but most are unique in their power and challenging.

I also wanted the objectives to be scaled to the power of the Keepers.  The Keepers have
unlimited energy, high hp, very powerful weapons, and they regenerate.  What can take on such
a force?  Well the bosses for one are a match for them.  Also, in one level the keepers can't
cloak due to radiation in the area, forcing them to be visible to hordes of enemies, making them
vulnerable.  Forcing a player to deal with a vulnerability is among the greatest challenges you
can throw at him/her.

To sum up, the objectives in FA are many, stuff to keep the player busy, lots of stuff to kill,
stuff to add tension, and a high challenge level.  Though people can use cheats, I implore you
not too.  The level is not 'that' hard, and if you beat it legitamately, trust me, you earned ten
pats on your back, because it's among the most difficult campaigns out there.

********************************************************************************************

"Lights, Camera, Action" (Special Visual FX)

I wanted FA to have a new splash screen (thanks to Joel it has a truly awesome one.).  I wanted
the Keepers to have new portraits (to be more immersive to the story.)  Again, thanks to Joel,
they have kick-ass portraits.  There's also a new picture for some signs (Dionysus level), as
well as new team colors (black) for the Keepers, new weapons for the Keepers (lasers), and a
cool picture of Ambrosia on the campaign select screen.

This stuff isn't 'necessary' to tell the story, but it helps, a lot.  Using Bliz's portraits will
remind players of those characters.  It just detracts from the story is all.  I know that Joel
and I debated about the Keeper helmets for awhile.  He wanted to render a helmet with the face
of the person inside somewhat visible through the visor.  I wanted the visor to be completely
mirrored so that no one could see in.  Much like Darth Vader in Star Wars, or the Stormtroopers,
there's just something ominous about not seeing the face of a warrior.

Special thanks to Joel for the awesome art and Quantam for compiling it in such a way that Fallen
Angel appears polished and professional in its interactive presentation.

**********************************************************************************************

"Sound"s like hogwash to me (Special Audio FX)

Probably the most time consuming aspect of designing Fallen Angel BY FAR was getting the
necessary vocal and sound effects.  Throughout the entire campaign, there are more than
500 voiced lines, and over 50 independent sound effects.  Let's start with the voices.

First, for the voices I did, or people local to me did, we record the vocals on my microphone
(Anitone 2001 -- XR-6 (A boom mic)), and then those files are saved onto the computer.  From
there, a few minutes goes into getting the *hiss* out of the recording that results from air
passing by the mic while we recorded the voice (air from a fan or air conditioner, or just
air in general.).

After that, the voice either needed to be altered, given a background, or both.  Let's look
at the Keeper voice.  First, the voice is cleaned up as described above, then, because they're
talking through a helmet mic, the voice had to sound 'tinny,' so a couple 'high-passes' were
needed to remove the bass.  Next, sound effects.  The Keepers have three sound effects when
they talk.  A breathing sound (unique to Fallen Angel), a humming sound behind that, and the
sound of their mic clicking on and off at the beginning and end of them talking.

So, from raw file to finished product, the average Keeper voice required between 8-2 minutes
to edit properly.  Multiply that by about 300 lines voiced by the Keepers.  You're looking
at about 2400-3600 minutes.  Boil that down to hours and you're looking at almost 48 hours of
work for that alone.  That's 8 hours a day for six days.

Take other voices in the campaign, like Commander Reeves.  He's got a flight controller
background inserted in his speech, to give the feel that he's really in a control tower.  Angel's
friend, Sergeant Meyers, has marine static in the background of his voice.  The Keeper Commanders
have voices modulated entirely.  And the most difficult voice in the campaign, the Zerg 
Cerebrate "ZUHL" has three separate recordings of his line pasted into one sound file, with each
line altered independently from the rest.

There is also the issue of Foley.  If a character is not in the room when talking to another
character, they're talking over a mic or a video screen.  In either case, their voice will come
through tinny.  Notice in the Dionysus level when Engineer Bill talks to the colony's
com-controller.  Depending on where you (the player) are centered, one voice will be normal, and
one will be tinny like it's talking through a mic into that room.  Then it could switch and
it's the other guy talking over the transmitter so now 'he's' tinny.

With sound effects, sometimes SC effects will do, but many times, as Fallen Angel is meant to
play more like an interactive movie, you need the true sound of an explosion.  Computer beeps,
fires, sparks flying, guns, alarms, all that stuff was added to various parts of Fallen Angel
to enhance the playing atmosphere.

**********************************************************************************************

In summary, FA required hundreds of man-hours of work from all who participated.  Special thanks
goes out especially to the crew without whom this campaign would not exist now.  The voice-actors
musicians, and our artist Joel Steudler all transformed Fallen Angel into the polished product
that it now is.

A lot of the design work on this was fun, a lot was not.  A lot was 'work', and many times I
would rather have put hot splinters under my pinky toe-nail than do work on the campaign
(especially the voice editing).  But in the end, it's all worth it.  With version 1.01 having
over 15,000 downloads on Fileplanet, we're pleased to have had the campaign played by so many.

It is true though as Thomas Edison said, "Invention is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration."  
Don't forget it.
