I:  INSTRUCTIONS 

0)  Before anything, go to your SC directory and look for a folder named "Sound" or "Portrait."  If they are there, rename them to something else so that the portraits and sounds there don't carry over to Fallen Angel.

a)  Now, move the contents of FallenAngel.ZIP into any folder of your choosing.  You can make a 
new directory for it, place the contents on your desktop, or in any existing folder. 

b)  Before activing the "LotC-FallenAngel.exe", be certain that you exit from any active session
of Broodwar or StarCraft. 

c)  Double click on the "LotC-FallenAngel.exe" 

d)  Broodwar will open up with a new title screen.  After the title screen, go to "Single Player"
and select the Fallen Angel campaign.   

e)  On the campaign screen, select the picture of the terran warrior to the left, and choose the 
mission "Dionysus."   

f)  Fasten your seat belts because the campaign is rocking and rolling. 

g)  **If you want to see the NexusCore video, select the "Play Intro" feature on the bottom left 
of the screen that allows you to choose between single and multi-player. 

h)  **Under no circumstances whatsoever should you use the cheat code "There is No Cow Level."  
This will desynch the campaigns. 



II:  BACKGROUND 

Legacy of the Confederation is a trilogy chronicling an alternate timeline in the Starcraft 
universe.  In this story, the Zerg invade and decimate the earth some 338 years before the 
events that take place in the Koprulu sector.  Out of the ashes arose the Confederation, a 
militarily driven society now spanning eighteen star systems that is determined to protect its 
safety and sovereignty at any cost. 

Throughout earth and the Confederation's history, shadow players have manipulated and influenced 
events in mainstream culture.  The chinese Triads, the Masons, and other secret societies have 
vied for control for more than a millenium, but none has carried as much weight as the anonymous 
and nearly omnipotent Illuminati.

The Illuminati held a stranglehold on global events for generations, and even after earth's 
destruction and subsequent rebuilding, this mammoth organization maintained its absolute control,
until fifty years prior to the events in Fallen Angel (2500-2505).  A great fracture ripped at 
the Illuminati's seams.  Radical right wing elements felt that a powerful military was 
insufficient to ensure the Confederation's safety.  They brought forth a draft within the 
membership to set ConFed in motion such that it would actively seek out and exterminate the 
Zerg species.  The Illuminati's council declined that motion, and so the organization split. 

One offshoot that resulted was the Keepers, a rogue Confederation agency that considers itself 
"Humanity's guardian Angel."  Home to convicts, politicians, former law enforcement, ex-military,
and mercenaries, the Keepers seek out and recruit only the most lethal personnel to be trained 
as assassins and infiltrators. 

One can never be certain where the next potential Keeper lies, but as you will see in Fallen 
Angel, even the champions of nobility, the proverbial white knights, can be shaped and molded 
into the most ruthless killers.  The light can always descend to darkness, it merely needs to 
be snuffed out.
